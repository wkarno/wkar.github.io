My name is Will Arnold and I am a PhD candidate in the laboratory of Dr. Brian Stevenson at the University of Kentucky. I study gene regulation in the Lyme disease pathogen, *Borrelia burgdorferi* to better understand the adaptations required for survival in this organisms unique enzootic cycle. I use a variety of standard molecular biology approaches combined with high-throughput sequencing and computational biology to investigate these questions.
